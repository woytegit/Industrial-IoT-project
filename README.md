# Industrial-IoT-project
Using Arduino, Blynk mobile application, and google maps API an intelligent home alarm was created. An application could send you an email or mobile notification with the information about your current distance from home based on localization from your Blynk app on your smartphone, current time travel by the car to your home including traffic on the road.
